 The Computer will create a 4-digit secret code
 The code can be made up of any combination of the colored pegs.

 Once the code is set, you can begin guessing
 Try to duplicate the exact colors and positions of the hidden Code pegs.

 Each guess is made by dragging a color to a pin
 Once you have 4 pins colored in press confirm

 After every guess, the Computer will inform you of your progress using
  different pins on the right side of your guess

 -A red circle means you have the right color on the right space
 -A white circle means you have the right color on the wrong space
 -An empty circle means you're missing the right color

 Good luck!
